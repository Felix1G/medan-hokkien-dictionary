## Medan Hokkien Dictionary

A dictionary web-app of the Medan Hokkien dialect, which has linguistic roots to Penang Hokkien and is a subdialect of Zhang Zhou Hokkien. It is majoritively spoken by Chinese Indonesians in Medan and surrounding cities, including Chinese migrant communities in Jakarta. This dictionary captures the common and less common words of Medan Hokkien, which may overlap with words from related languages, namely Penang Hokkien, Singapore Hokkien, and Taiwanese.

This dictionary hopes to preserve Medan Hokkien digitally while making it accessible for others who are curious of the language.

[Traditional Chinese Characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters) (繁體) and [POJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe̍h-ōe-jī) are used. Whenever possible, I reference [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org) for "standardised" POJ and Chinese Characters. As a vernacular language, not all words have established characters, so please take them with a grain of salt.

Note: This project is made for fun. I try to ensure the entries are as accurate as possible to the actual vocabulary we use in Medan Hokkien. However, I am not a professional linguist or dictionary writer, so please do not consider this dictionary as serious academic material. There will be mistakes here and there, but I hope it sparks curiosity and interest for readers :)
